# Isaias

## Chapter 1

### verse 1.1

<p>I. 1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw
concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham,
Ahaz, (and) Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>

### verse 1.2

<p>2 Hear, Ο heavens, and give ear, Ο earth: for the LORD hath
spoken, I have nourished and brought up sons, and they have
rebelled against me.</p>

### verse 1.3

<p>3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his ’s crib:
Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</p>

### verse 1.4

<p>4 Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
evildoers, sons that deal corruptly; they have forsaken the LORD,
they have scorned the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away
backward.</p>

### verse 1.5

<p>5 Why will ye be still stricken, (that) ye revolt more and more?
the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</p>

### verse 1.6

<p>6 From the sole of the foot even unto the head (there is) no
soundness in it; wound, and weal, and putrefying sore: they
have not been pressed out, neither bound up, neither is it
mollified with oil.</p>

### verse 1.7

<p>7 Your country is a desolation, your cities are burned with
ﬁre; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is a
desolation, like an overthrow of strangers.</p>

### verse 1.8

<p>8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as
a ’tent in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</p>

### verse 1.9

<p>9 Except the LORD of Hosts had left us a very small remnant,
we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto
Gomorrah.</p>

### verse 1.10

<p>10 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ye
ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah.</p>

### verse 1.11

<p>11 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto
me? saith the LORD: I am sated with the burnt offerings of rams,
and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of
bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</p>

### verse 1.12

<p>12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this
at your hand, to trample my courts?</p>

### verse 1.13

<p>13 Bring no more vain (meal-) offerings; incense is an abomination
unto me; new moons and sabbaths, callings of assemblies;
I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meetings.</p>

### verse 1.14

<p>14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth:
they are a cumbrance unto me: I am weary of bearing.</p>

### verse 1.15

<p>15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
from you; yea, when ye multiply prayer, I will not hear; your
hands are full of blood.</p>

### verse 1.16

<p>16 Wash you, make you clean; remove the evil of your doings
from before mine eyes; cease to do evil,</p>

### verse 1.17

<p>17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, correct the oppressore
judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p>

### verse 1.18

<p>18 Come now, and let us confer together, saith the LORD;
though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow:
though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>

### verse 1.19

<p>19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
land:</p>

### verse 1.20

<p>20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be eaten (by) the sword
for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</p>

### verse 1.21

<p>21 How is the faithful city become an harlot! she (that) was
full of judgment, righteousness lodged in her; but now murderers:</p>

### verse 1.22

<p>22 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine impaired with water:</p>

### verse 1.23

<p>23 Thy princes (are) rebellious, and companions of thieves:
every one of them loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they
judge not the fatherless, ’doth the cause of the widow
come unto them.</p>

### verse 1.24

<p>24 Therefore thus saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the
mighty one of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and
avenge me of mine enemies.</p>

### verse 1.25

<p>25 And I will bring back mine hand upon thee, and purge
away as (with) lye thy dross, and take away all thine alloy:</p>

### verse 1.26

<p>26 And I will restore thy judges as at the ﬁrst, and thy
counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called
Citadel of righteousness, faithful city.</p>

### verse 1.27

<p>27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts
with righteousness.</p>

### verse 1.28

<p>28 And (there shall be) a shattering of the rebels and of the
sinners together, and they that forsake the LORD shall come to an
end.</p>

### verse 1.29

<p>29 For they shall be ashamed of the terebinths which ye have
desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have
chosen.</p>

### verse 1.30

<p>30 For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf withereth, and as
a garden that hath no water.</p>

### verse 1.31

<p>31 And the strong shall become as tow, and his work as a
spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench
them.</p>

come to pass.</p>

Restorer of paths to dwell in.</p>

### verse 58.13

<p>13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, as to doing
thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight,
the holy (day) of the LORD honourable; and honour it, not
doing thine own ways, not ﬁnding thine own pleasure, nor
speaking words:</p>

### verse 58.14

<p>14 Then shalt thou have thy delight in the LORD; and I will
cause thee to ride upon the heights of the earth, and to eat
the heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the LORD
hath spoken it.</p>

## Chapter 59

### verse 59.1

<p>LIX. 1 Behold, the ’S hand is not shortened, that it
cannot save ; neither his ear grown heavy, that it cannot hear:</p>

### verse 59.2

<p>2 But your iniquities have been separating between you and
your God, and your sins have hidden the Face from you, that
he hear not.</p>

### verse 59.3

<p>3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your ﬁngers
with iniquity; your lips have spoken falsehood, your tongue will
mutter wickedness.</p>

### verse 59.4

<p>4 There is none that sueth in righteousness, and none that
pleadeth in truth; they trust in emptiness, and speak vanity;
they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</p>

### verse 59.5

<p>5 They hatch ’s eggs, and weave spider's webs; he that
eateth of their eggs shall die, and that which is crushed, it
hatcheth out into an adder.</p>

### verse 59.6

<p>6 Their webs shall not serve for a garment, neither shall they
cover themselves with their works; their works are works of
iniquity, and the practice of violence is in their hands.</p>

### verse 59.7

<p>7 Their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed innocent
blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity, wasting and destruction
are in their highways.</p>

### verse 59.8

<p>8 The way of peace they know not, and there is no judgment
in their tracks; they have made them their paths crooked; whosoever
goeth therein knoweth not peace.</p>

### verse 59.9

<p>9 Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth righteousness
overtake us; we wait for light, and behold darkness; for
brightness,—we walk in</p>

### verse 59.10

<p>10 We grope along the wall like blind men, and we grope as
men without eyes; we have stumbled at noonday as in the dusk;
among the vigorous as the dead.</p>

### verse 59.11

<p>11 We all groan like bears, and moan piteously like doves;
we wait for judgment, and there is none; for salvation, it is
far off from us.</p>

### verse 59.12

<p>12 For our rebellions are multiplied before thee, and our sins
testify against us; for our rebellions are with us, and our
iniquities, we know them:</p>

### verse 59.13

<p>13 Rebelling and denying the LORD, and drawing back from
following our God: speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving
and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</p>

### verse 59.14

<p>14 And judgment is driven backward, and righteousness
standeth afar off; for truth hath stumbled in the broad place,
and uprightness cannot enter.</p>

### verse 59.15

<p>15 And truth is (found) missing, and he that removeth from
evil maketh himself a prey; and the LORD saw it, and it was
evil in his eyes that there was no judgment.</p>

### verse 59.16

<p>16 And he saw that there was no man, and was amazed that
there was none that interposed; therefore his own arm wrought
salvation for him, and his righteousness, it upheld him.</p>

### verse 59.17

<p>17 And he put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and a
helmet of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments
of vengeance for clothing, and wrapped himself in jealousy as
a cloke.</p>

### verse 59.18

<p>18 According to their deeds, accordingly will he requite, fury
to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies; to the isles he
will requite recompense.</p>

### verse 59.19

<p>19 And they shall fear the name of the LORD from the setting,
and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he shall come as
a pent-up stream, which the breath of the LORD driveth.</p>

### verse 59.20

<p>20 And a redeemer shall come to Zion, and to them that turn
from rebellion in Jacob, saith the LORD.</p>

### verse 59.21

<p>21 And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the
LORD; my Spirit that is upon thee, and my words that I have
put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out
of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's
seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.</p>

lattices?</p>

<p>9 Surely the isles are waiting for me, and the ships of Tarshish
ﬁrst, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with
them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy
One of Israel; for he hath beautified thee.</p>

### verse 60.10

<p>10 And aliens shall build thy walls, and their kings shall
minister unto thee; for in my wrath I smote thee, and in my
favour have I had mercy upon thee.</p>

<p>11 And thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not
be shut, day and night; to bring unto thee the wealth of nations,
and their kings led along;</p>

<p>12 For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee
shall perish; and the nations shall be utterly wasted.</p>

### verse 60.13

the plane tree and the larch together, to beautify the place
of my sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet
honourable.</p>

### verse 60.14

<p>14 And the sons of them that afflicted thee shall go unto
thee, bowing down; and all they that scorned thee shall bow
themselves to the soles of thy feet; and they shall call thee the
City of the LORD, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</p>

### verse 60.15

<p>15 Instead of thy being forsaken and hated, and none passing
through thee; I will set thee for an everlasting pride, a gladness
of generation upon generation.</p>

### verse 60.16

<p>16 And thou shalt suck the milk of nations, and shalt suck
the breast of kings; and thou shalt know that I the LORD am thy
Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob.</p>

### verse 60.17

<p>17 Instead of brass I will bring gold, and instead of iron
I will bring silver, and instead of wood brass, and instead of
stones iron; and I will make thy government peace, and thine
overseers righteousness.</p>

### verse 60.18

<p>18 Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor
destruction in thy borders; and thou shalt call thy walls Salvation,
and thy gates Praise.</p>

### verse 60.19

<p>19 The sun shall no more be thy light by day; and as for
shining, the moon shall not give light to thee; and the LORD
shall be to thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy beauty.</p>

<p>LXI. 1 The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because

afflicted; hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim
liberty to captives, and opening of eyes to the bound:</p>

### verse 61.2

of vengeance for our God; to comfort all mourners</p>

swaying in the mightiness of his strength? I, that speak in
righteousness, mighty to save.</p>

like one that treadeth in a winepress?</p>

### verse 63.3

there was not a man with me; and I trode them in mine anger,
and trampled them in my fury; and their life blood was sprinkled
on my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.</p>

### verse 63.4

<p>4 For a day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my
redeemed ones is come.</p>

<p>6 Ahd I trampled the people in mine anger, and made them
drunk in my fury, and brought down their life blood to the earth.</p>

### verse 63.7

<p>7 I will recall the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, the praises
of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath recompensed
to us, and the abundance of good toward the house of Israel
which he hath recompensed to them, according to his mercies,

days of old.</p>

### verse 63.10

<p>10 And they rebelled and grieved his holy Spirit; and he
turned to be their enemy, and himself fought against them.</p>

### verse 63.11

<p>11 And he remembered the days of old, Moses, his people;
Where is he that brought them up out of the sea, with the
shepherd of his ﬂock? Where is he that put his holy Spirit
within him?</p>

### verse 63.12

<p>12 That caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of
Moses, dividing the waters before them, to make himself an
everlasting name?</p>

### verse 63.13

<p>13 That caused them to go through the deeps, like a horse
in the wilderness, without stumbling?</p>

LORD brought him to rest; so didst thou lead thy people, to
make thyself a name of beauty.</p>

holiness and thy beauty: where is thy jealousy, and thy mighty
acts? the sounding of thy bowels and thy mercies are restrained

<p>16 For thou art our father; for Abraham knoweth us not,
Israel doth not recognize us: thy name is Our Redeemer from

hadst come down, that the mountains had quaked at thy
Presence!</p>

boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, (that) nations

the ear, eye hath not seen a God beside thee, who will work for
him that waiteth for him.</p>

be saved?</p>

### verse 64.6

<p>6 And we are all become as one unclean, and all our
righteousnesses as a polluted garment; and we are all withered
as the leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, will take us away.</p>

thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.</p>

## Chapter 65

### verse 65.1

<p>LXV. 1 I was to be inquired of by them that asked not,
have let myself be found by them that sought me not; I said,
Here am I, Here am I, unto a nation that was not called by
my name.</p>

### verse 65.2

<p>2 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a refractory
people, which walk in a way which is not good, after their own
thoughts.</p>

### verse 65.3

<p>3 The people that irritate me continually to my face; which
sacrifice in the gardens, and burn incense upon the bricks:</p>

### verse 65.4

<p>4 Which sit in the graves, and lodge in guarded places, which
eat swine's ﬂesh, and broth of abominations is in their vessels:</p>

### verse 65.5

<p>5 Which say, Keep to thyself, come not near to me; for I am
holy to thee. These are a smoke in my nose, a ﬁre that burneth
all the day.</p>

of Achor a resting place for oxen, for my people that have
inquired of me.</p>

### verse 65.11

<p>11 And as for you, that forsake the LORD, that forget my
holy mountain, that set in order a table for Fortune, that ﬁll
up a mingled draught for Destiny:</p>

### verse 65.12

<p>12 I will (even) destine you for the sword, and ye shall all
crouch down to the slaughter; because I called, and ye did not
answer; I spake, and ye did not hear; but did evil before mine
eyes, and chose that in which I took not pleasure.</p>

<p>19 And I Will exult in Jerusalem, and rejoice in my people,
and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her, nor
the voice of crying out.</p>

### verse 65.20

<p>20 There shall be no more from thence an infant of days, or
an old man, that shall not fulfil his days: for the youth a
hundred years old shall die, and the sinner a hundred years
old shall be accursed</p>

### verse 65.21

<p>21 And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they
shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</p>

### verse 65.22

plant, and another eat; for as the days of the tree are the days
of my people, and my chosen shall wear out the works of
their hands.</p>

<p>23 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for terror;
for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their
offspring (shall be) with them.</p>

<p>24 And it shall be, before they shall call, I will answer; still
shall they be speaking, and I will hear.</p>

will build unto me? and where is this place of my rest?</p>

### verse 66.2

<p>2 And all these things hath my hand made, and all these
things came to be, saith the LORD; and to this one will I look,
to him who is afflicted and contrite in spirit, and trembleth at
my word.</p>

### verse 66.3

<p>3 He that slaughtereth the ox, slayeth a man; he that
sacrificeth the sheep, breaketh a ’s neck; he that offereth
a meal offering, sweene's blood: he that maketh a memorial of
incense, blesseth iniquity. Also they have chosen their own
ways, and their soul taketh pleasure in their abominations.</p>

### verse 66.4

<p>4 Also I will choose their mockeries, and will bring their fears
upon them; because I called, and there was none that answered;
I spake, and there was none that heard; and they did evil before
mine eyes, and chose that in which I took not pleasure.</p>

<p>7 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before pain came to
her, she was delivered of a man child.</p>

Shall a land be travailed with in one day? shall a nation be born
at once? for Zion travailed, she also brought forth her sons.</p>

<p>9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?
saith the LORD; shall I, that cause to bring forth, shut up (the
womb)? saith thy God.</p>

consolations: that ye may milk out, and delight yourselves from
the fulness of her glory.</p>

like a river, and the glory of nations like an ﬂowing stream:
and ye shall suck; ye shall be borne upon the side, be
