but Israel knoweth me not, and the people understandeth me not.</p>

sons: ye have forsaken the Lord, and angered the Holy One of
Israel.</p>

every head (turns) to weariness, and every heart to grief.</p>

inflamed hurt: there is no means to apply a balm, or oil, or
bandages.</p>

country, strangers devour it before your face, and it has been
desolated, ruined by stranger peoples.</p>

and like a watching-hut in a cucumber garden, like a city
besieged.</p>

should have become as Sodom, and we should have been made
like as Gomorrah.</p>

to the law of God, people of Gomorrah.</p>

### verse 1.11

### verse 1.12

<p>12 Not even if ye come to appear before me. For who hath
demanded this of your hands? Tread my court</p>

### verse 1.13

<p>13 Ye shall not, any more; if ye bring me ﬁne ﬂour, it is vain;

sabbaths, and a great day, I cannot bear: fasting and idleness,</p>

### verse 1.14

ye are become to me a surfeit! no longer will I let your sins be.</p>

mine eyes from you; and if ye multiply your petition, I will not

<p>20 But if ye be not willing, neither hearken unto me, a sword ’
shall devour you; for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken this.</p>

### verse 1.21

<p>21 How is the faithful city Zion become a harlot! (once)
full of judgment, and in her righteousness did rest; but now
murderers.</p>

### verse 1.22

<p>22 Your silver is base; thy hucksters mix the wine with water:</p>

### verse 1.23

<p>23 Thy rulers are disobedient; companions of thieves, that
love gifts, that pursue a recompense; that judge not for orphans,
and attend not to the cause of a widow.</p>

### verse 1.24

strong ones of Israel! for my wrath shall not cease upon mine
adversaries, and I will exact judgment from mine enemies.</p>

desired, and shall be ashamed for their gardens, which they longed for.</p>

<p>30 For they shall be as a terebinth that hath cast off its leaves,
and as a park with no water.</p>

### verse 1.31

<p>31 And their strength shall be as a stalk of ﬂax, and their
works as sparks of ﬁre, and the transgressors and the sinners
shall be burned up together, and there shall be none that shall
quench them.</p>

### verse 2.2

from Jerusalem.</p>

the Strangers, and many strange children are born to them.</p>

<p>7 For their country is ﬁlled with silver and gold, and there
is no number to their treasures; and their land is ﬁlled with
horses, and there is no number to their chariots:</p>

### verse 2.8

<p>8 And the land is ﬁlled with abominations, the works of their
hands, and they worship things which their own ﬁngers have
made:</p>

and I will not let them be.</p>

earth, from before the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his
strength, when he ariseth to shatter the earth.</p>

humble: and the uplifting of men shall be humbled, and the
Lord alone shall be uplifted in that day.</p>

<p>12 For there is a day of the Lord of Hosts against every
worker of pride, and overweening one, and against every one that
is high and lofty, and they shall be humbled:</p>

### verse 2.13

<p>13 And against every cedar of Lebanon, of them that are high
and lofty, and against every oak-tree of Bashan,</p>

### verse 2.14

<p>14 And against every mountain, and against every high
hill,</p>

<p>15 And against every high tower, and against every high
wall,</p>

shall fall, and the Lord alone shall be uplifted in that day.</p>

<p>19 Carrying them into the caves, and into the rents of the
rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the fear of the
Lord, and from the glory of his strength, when he ariseth to
shatter the earth.</p>

### verse 2.20

<p>20 In that day shall a man cast out his abominations, the
silver and the golden, which he made to worship, to the vain ones
and to the bats;</p>

### verse 2.21

<p>21 To go into the holes of the solid rock, and into the rents of
the rocks, from before the face of the Lord, and from the glory of
his strength, when he ariseth to shatter the earth.

set up his people for judgment.</p>

poor?</p>

### verse 3.16

<p>5 And he shall come, and it shall be, every place of the mount
Zion, and all that is round about her; a cloud shall shadow it by
day, and like as when smoke and as a light of ﬁre burneth by
night; it shall be sheltered by all the glory (of the Lord),</p>

for my vineyard. My beloved hath a vineyard on a hill-top, in
a fertile place;</p>

a vine of Sorek, and built a tower in the midst of it, and digged
a wine-fat therein; and I waited for it to bring forth a cluster of
grapes, and it brought forth thorns.</p>

<p>3 And now, man of Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem,
judge ye betwixt me and my vineyard.</p>

nor digged; and there shall come up into it thorns, as into
a waste place; and I will command the clouds, to shower no
rain upon it.</p>

### verse 5.7

<p>7 For the vineyard of the Lord of Hosts is the house of Israel,
and the man of Judah a beloved young plant; I waited for (him)
to bring forth judgment, but he brought forth transgression, and
not righteousness, but a cry.</p>

### verse 5.8

<p>8 Woe, they that join house to house, and set ﬁeld next to
ﬁeld, that they may rob somewhat from their neighbour; will ye
dwell alone upon the earth?</p>

### verse 5.9

<p>9 For this was heard in the ears of the Lord of Hosts; For if
houses become many, they shall be a desolation; great ones and
fair, and there shall be none that inhabit them.</p>

### verse 5.10

### verse 5.11

<p>11 Woe, they that rise up early, and follow strong drink; that
tarry till late; for wine shall burn them up.</p>

### verse 5.12

<p>12 For with harp, and psaltery, and tabrets, and pipes, drink
they their wine; but they regard not the works of the Lord,
and the works of his hands they consider not.</p>

### verse 5.13

<p>13 Therefore is my people become captive, because they
know not the Lord; and is become a multitude of dead bodies,
because of famine and thirst for water.</p>

### verse 5.14

<p>14 And Hades enlarged his appetite, and opened his mouth,
continually; and her glorious, and great, and rich ones, and her
pestilences, shall descend.</p>

### verse 5.15

<p>15 And the mean man shall be humbled, and the great man
shall be dishonoured, and the eyes that are lifted up shall be
humbled:</p>

<p>16 And the Lord of Hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and
God, the Holy One, shall be glorified in righteousness.</p>

### verse 5.17

<p>17 And they that are spoiled shall graze as bulls, and the
waste places of them that are taken away shall lambs eat.</p>

### verse 5.18

<p>18 Woe, they that drag along their sins as with a long rcpe,
and their transgressions as with a cow-hide chariot trace:</p>

### verse 5.19

<p>19 That say, Let him speedily bring near what he will do, that
we may see; and let the counsel of the Holy One &amp;003C; of Israel
come, that we may perceive:</p>

### verse 5.20

<p>20 Woe, they that call evil good, and good evil; that set darkness
as light, and light as darkness; that set bitter as sweet, and
sweet as bitter!</p>

### verse 5.21

<p>21 Woe, they that are prudent in themselves, and have understanding
in their own sight!</p>

### verse 5.22

<p>22 Woe, they that are strong among you, that drink wine, and
the powerful ones, that mingle the strong drink:</p>

### verse 5.23

<p>23 That justify the impious for ’ sake, and remove the
justice of the just.</p>

### verse 5.24

<p>24 Therefore, like as a reed shall be burned by coals of fire.
and burned up by blazing ﬂame, their root shall be as chaff, and
their blossom shall go up as whirling dust: for they desired not
the law of the Lord of Hosts, but they provoked the oracle of &lt;
Holy One of &gt; Israel.</p>

### verse 5.25

<p>25 And the Lord of Hosts was wroth with anger against his
people, and laid his hand upon them, and smote them; and the
mountains were provoked (to anger), and their carcases became as
dung in the midst of the way. Amid all this his wrath is not
turned away, but his hand is still upraised.</p>

### verse 5.26

<p>26 Therefore he shall raise up a signal among the nations afar
off, and shall hiss unto them from the end of the earth; and,
behold, quickly they come swiftly.</p>

### verse 5.27

<p>27 They shall not &lt;hunger nor&gt; grow weary, nor nod, nor
sleep, nor shall they loose their girdles from their loins, nor shall
the thongs of their sandals be broken:</p>

### verse 5.28

<p>28 Whose darts are sharp, and their bows bent; their ’
hoofs are as solid rock; the wheels of their chariots were counted
as a whirlwind.</p>

### verse 5.29

<p>29 They spring like lions, and are come up like a ’s
whelp; and he shall take hold, and shall roar as a wild beast, and
shall cast them out, and there shall be none that delivereth them,</p>

### verse 5.30

<p>30 And he shall roar because of them, in that day, as the voice
of a surging sea; and they shall look upon the earth, and behold,
cruel darkness in their dismay.</p>

## Chapter 6

### verse 6.1

<p>VI. 1 And it came to pass, in the year that king Uzziah died,
I saw the Lord seated upon a throne, (that was) high and lifted
up, and the house was full of his glory.</p>

### verse 6.2

<p>2 And seraphim stood around him; each one had six wings;
and with twain they covered their face, and with twain they
covered their feet, and with twain they did fly.</p>

### verse 6.3

<p>3 And they cried one to another and said, Holy, holy, holy, is
the Lord of Hosts; all the earth is full of his glory.</p>

### verse 6.4

<p>4 And the lintel was lifted up, at the voice with which they
cried, and the house was ﬁlled with smoke.</p>

### verse 6.5

<p>5 And I said, O wretched me, for I am amazed; for being
(but) a man, and with impure lips, I dwell in the midst of a
people with impure lips: and I have seen the King, the Lord of
Hosts, with mine eyes.</p>

### verse 6.6

<p>6 And there was sent to me one of the seraphim, and in his
hand he had a coal of ﬁre, which he had taken with the tongs
from the altar;</p>

thy lips, and shall take away thy transgressions, and shall purify
thy sins.</p>

serial, and who will go to this people? And I said, Here am I;
sen me.</p>

bear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not
perceive.</p>

### verse 6.10

<p>10 For the heart of this people. is made fat, and with their
ears they hear dully, and their eyes have they closed; lest at any
time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
pgidrirstand with their heart, and should return, when I will heal
them.</p>

### verse 6.11

<p>11. And I said, Until when, Lord P And he said, Until cities be
desolated, because they are not inhabited, and houses, because
there are no men; and the land shall be left desolate.</p>

### verse 6.12

<p>12 And after this, God shall far remove men, and they that
are left shall be multiplied upon the earth.</p>

### verse 6.13

<p>13 And still upon it is the tenth part, and again it shall be for
plunder; as a terebinth, and as an oak, when it is torn from its
place.</p>

of the fuller's ﬁeld;</p>

of smoking firehrands; for when the anger of my wrath is come,
I will heal again.</p>

### verse 7.5

<p>5 And (as for) the son of Aram and the son of Remaliah,
because they have counselled evil counsel concerning thee, saying,

neither shall it be.</p>
