# Preface to Historia Ecclesiastica  

## §1  

<p>THE text of the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius in
          the following pages is that of E. Schwartz in volumes
          i and ii. of Part II. of the edition of Eusebius in
          Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der erstern
          drei Gahrhunderte, published by the Berlin Academy.
          Changes have only been introduced in a few very
          small points, such as the accentuation of the proper
          names in the genealogy of Christ.</p>  

## §2  

<p>I am most grateful to the Academy for its kindness
          in allowing me the use of this magnificent
          example of how a text ought to be edited.</p>  

## §3  

<p>In preparing the English I have in difficult passages
          frequently consulted the translation of A.C.M‘Giffert
          and have derived much benefit from his notes. I
          am also greatly indebted to my friends Mrs.
          Frederick Winslow, Professor Robert P. Blake, who
          read proof-sheets and suggested many improvements,
          and Miss Edith Coe, who helped at every stage,
          and undertook the laborious work of verifying and
          inserting the references which were taken from
          Schwartz.</p>
