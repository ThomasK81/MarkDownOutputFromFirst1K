## Text  
### 1  
THE text of the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius in the following pages is that of E. Schwartz in volumes i and ii. of Part II. of the edition of Eusebius in Die griechischen christlichen Schriftsteller der erstern drei Gahrhunderte, published by the Berlin Academy. Changes have only been introduced in a few very small points, such as the accentuation of the proper names in the genealogy of Christ.

I am most grateful to the Academy for its kindness in allowing me the use of this magnificent example of how a text ought to be edited.

In preparing the English I have in difficult passages frequently consulted the translation of A.C.M‘Giffert and have derived much benefit from his notes. I am also greatly indebted to my friends Mrs. Frederick Winslow, Professor Robert P. Blake, who read proof-sheets and suggested many improvements, and Miss Edith Coe, who helped at every stage, and undertook the laborious work of verifying and inserting the references which were taken from Schwartz.
